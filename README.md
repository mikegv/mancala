## Overview

Tasked with creating a game using React, I choose to build Mancala. It is a two player game, meant to be played on a single computer.

### What I learned

This project taught me so much about developing a bigger application. While it may not be big compared to other code bases, this was my first large project with React. I built an animation that would start with a user click but then change based on a condition. I also learned how difficult it can start to get keeping track of what props are being passed around between components.
